 * <h2>OWLTools and Solr</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This package contains major loading methods for taking files parsed by OWLTools and loading them into a Solr index.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some of the basic groundwork is covered by {@link owltools.solrj.AbstractSolrLoader}, but the two extreme specific cases are
 * probably better examples for the possible ways of loading an index.
