def: "A material entity of anatomical origin (part of or deriving from an organism) that has as its parts a maximally connected cell compartment surrounded by a plasma membrane." [CARO:mah]
comment: The definition of cell is intended to represent all cells, and thus a cell is defined as a material entity and not an anatomical structure, which implies that it is part of an organism (or the entirety of one).

def: "A cell that is found in a natural setting, which includes multicellular organism cells 'in vivo' (i.e. part of an organism), and unicellular organisms 'in environment' (i.e. part of a natural environment)." [CARO:mah]
comment: To accommodate unicellular organisms better, 'cell in vivo' has been re-labeled 'native cell' to better represent its intended meaning - that is, that it is a cell in the context of a multicellular organism or in a natural environment. 'Native' is intended to contrast with 'in vitro', which refers to cells or other biological entities that have been intentionally placed in a controlled, non-natural setting for the purpose of study or manipulation.

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this.

comment: Note that this term differs from 'cytokinesis ; GO:0000910' in that cytokinesis excludes nuclear division; in prokaryotes, there is little difference between cytokinesis and cell division. Note that there is no relationship between this term and 'nuclear division ; GO:0000280' because cell division can take place without nuclear division (as in prokaryotes) and vice versa (as in syncytium formation by mitosis without cytokinesis.

The concept of bilaterian nervous system centralization implies that neuron types concentrate on one side of the trunk, as is the case in vertebrates and many invertebrates including Platynereis, where they segregate and become spatially organized (as opposed to a diffuse nerve net).

def: "In amniote animal embryology, the epiblast is a tissue type derived either from the inner cell mass in mammals or the blastodisc in birds and reptiles. It lies above the hypoblast. In mammalian embryogenesis, the columnar cells of the epiblast are adjacent to the trophoblast, while the cuboidal cells of the hypoblast are closer to the blastocoele. The epiblast, whilst referred to as the primary ectoderm, differentiates to form all three layers of the trilaminar germ disc in a process called gastrulation[WP]. The outer of the two layers of the blastoderm that form during gastrulation, corresponding to primitive ectoderm during gastrulation and to the definitive ectoderm after gastrulation[ZFA]" [Wikipedia:Epiblast, ZFIN:curator]
comment: MP says - tissue that gives rise to the ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm of the embryo proper. In HOG, epiblast is part of primitive streak/blastpore, which is inconsistent with the MP definition of primitive streak as a ridge of the epiblast. Note that these terms, epiblast and hypoblast, are also used to describe layers of the avian embryonic blastoderm, but the layers so-named seem to be altogether different in these two kinds of vertebrate embryos(CVS). Consider obsoleting this as a grouping class
subset: early_development  ! A class that represents an early developmental structure, like a blastocyst. This part of the ontology is undergoing review to remove inappropriate grouping classes.
subset: grouping_class  ! Subset consisting of classes creating for grouping purposes
subset: uberon_slim  ! Uberon slim - somewhat arbitrary subset that excludes obscure terms and deep compositional terms
subset: vertebrate_core  ! core classes typically found across vertebrates. one purpose is to create a rough set of terms that could be used to start a new vertebrate AO

In amniote embryos (mammals and birds), gastrulation initiates in an epithelial layer called the epiblast. Cells in the epiblast undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), migrate through the primitive streak (PS), and incorporate in the middle (mesoderm) or outer (endoderm) layer. The presumptive definitive endoderm (DE) cells invade and displace an outer layer of extraembryonic tissue cells, the hypoblast in chick and the visceral endoderm (VE) in mouse, which form supporting structures such as the yolk sac.[uncertain][VHOG]" xsd:string
